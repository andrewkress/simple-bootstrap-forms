# Simple::Bootstrap::Forms
Simply override the default generators to use bootstrap classes in rails without any dependencies that will be out of date because the maintainer hasn't updated their gem in 4 years.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple-bootstrap-forms'
```
or
```ruby
gem 'simple-bootstrap-forms', github: 'andrewkress/simple-bootstrap-forms'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ rails g simple_bootstrap_forms
```

3 files will be generated:

- config/initializers/simple_boostrap_forms.rb (Config to suppress generating scaffold.scss)
- lib/templates/erb/scaffold/_form.html.erb (Simple override to the standard generator)
- app/views/shared/_error.html.erb (Shared error partial to keep code DRY)
